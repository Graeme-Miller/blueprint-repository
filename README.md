### catalog.bom

This should be a well-formed and valid Apache Brooklyn catalog file, as described in the Brooklyn [catalog documentation](http://brooklyn.incubator.apache.org/v/latest/ops/catalog/index.html).

The catalog metadata part will contain these keys:

| Key              | Optionality | Notes                                                                                                                                                         |
